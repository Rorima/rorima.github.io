# Plan for the word counter

* It will be a big text box
* The user will paste a text and the program is going to count the words
* There program must show the reading time (250wpm?)
* The program must count how many sentences
* The program must count how many paragraphs
* A word is defined by a string of characters separated by space
* Characters counted as words must be numbers and letters, but special characters must not be counted as words
* The text box will be in the middle
* The information about the text will be on the top
